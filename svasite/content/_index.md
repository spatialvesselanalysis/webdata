# Spatial Vessel Analysis 

## Overview
The following pipeline offers a robust, reproducible, and scalable solution for extracting vessel-related features from histological images. Accurate vascular network segmentation provides key insights into vascular conformation and remodeling. Additionally, this pipeline also correlates vascular structures with drug distribution. 

While particularly relevant in oncology for characterizing the tumor microenvironment, it may also be applied to other diseases where vascular alterations are of paramount importance, including those involving inflammation, fibrosis, and microvascular dysfunction. By enhancing our understanding of vascular-mediated disease progression and treatment delivery, this approach supports both research and clinical decision-making.

## Objectives
- Quantitative Analysis: Extracts precise vessel morphology and spatial distribution metrics.

- Automated & Scalable: Processes large datasets efficiently, reducing manual workload.

- Open-Source & Modifiable: Easily adaptable to different research contexts and imaging modalities.

- Interdisciplinary Integration: Combines pathology and bioinformatic image analysis.
